# plotly_challenge

I began this project by building all plots based on the first subject listed in the data file (index 0).  Variables were created for easy access to specific elements of the samples data and metadata throughout the project.  Next, I looped through the list of names and appended them to the dropdown menu.  Once all plots were functioning on index[0], I created the function that would change all of the plots and data on the page when a new subject ID was chosen from the dropdown menu.  

When everything was functioning correctly, I uploaded the final files to GitHub for deployment to GitHub pages.  At this point, I struggled with the data file being accessible, so decided to reorganize the files slightly, which solved the problem.
